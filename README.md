# Tools for brute force and k-th fold optimization, technical analysis, strategy development, hedging, HTML scraping, task automation, supervised learning, model evaluation, data visualization, directory creation and maintenance.
# People involved in time series and risk analysis - traders, risk managers, finance students, etc. may find useful tools here.
# Most apps are built around Yahoo! time series style dataframes; however, the addition of feature columns to the time series are helpful for machine learning.
# To install, download MasterLibrary to working directory. Most apps will run without any configuration - any apps using pandas_datareader should be modified to use YahooGrabberII.py. You may choose to run EntityCreation.py to set up a folder heirarcy (input directory location), and then reference directory location and run YahooDataScraper.py - this will populate a local folder directory - use UniverseList.csv and NASDAQData.csv in YahooDataScraper.py. You may chose to quickstart and just pull data into apps with YahooGrabber.py.
# HTTP requests from YahooGrabberII.py feed most of the apps data for calculation.
